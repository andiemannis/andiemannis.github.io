         <p>In today’s society, many struggle with their mental health and often are unable to find proper medical assistance or local mental health facilities available. Mental health affects a large portion of our population, and it is important that those who are affected understand that treatment is available through datasets and online resources. </p>
        <p>If those who are struggling with mental health issues do not receive proper treatment, they will most likely suffer the consequences of untreated mental health conditions including physical health problems, substance abuse, and unfortunately even suicide.</p> 
        <p>Fortunately, though, there are many available resources available to help those who are struggling with mental health including the dataset “Local Mental Health Programs” provided by the Division of Quality Management. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1 in 4 people worldwide will be affected by a mental disorder at some point in their lives. </p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>Mental health disorders are common in all countries and across all age groups, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Therefore, this topic should be discussed more often as it is important for those affected by mental health disorders to become aware of available resources aiming to help.</p>
        <p>Moreover, college students, specifically, often struggle with their mental health due to the large amounts of academic and societal pressure. To gain a better understanding of the importance of local mental health facilities, I interviewed several people familiar with the subject of psychology including Jacob Samuel, an alumni of the University of Michigan’s psychology department.</p>
        <p>Samuel shared that “local mental facilities are important because oftentimes people need urgent and immediate care in their area and also may need help in an efficient and easy way.” He also shared that many, if not all, college campuses, including the University of Michigan, contain on-campus resources such as therapists and psychologists to help students that are struggling with mental health disorders.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>The dataset “Local Mental Health Programs” provided by the Division of Quality Management helped me gather information about the mental health facilities available to those in the state of New York. This dataset contains very helpful information including the types of mental health services each program provides, the county in which the program is located, and contact information for each program. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, it is updated on a regular basis and can therefore provide locals with the information of new resources. In addition to this dataset, there is also available data regarding local mental health programs in many other cities and states. There are also datasets that are published as maps that display where certain mental health programs are located to better help people visualize the data.</p>
        <p>To conclude, issues like mental health are prevalent in today’s society. Moreover, it is reassuring to know there are resources available to help those struggling with mental health or other physical and mental disorders.</p>
