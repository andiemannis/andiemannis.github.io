	<p>The House GOP issued its first subpoena in the investigation of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office on Thursday. The subpoena was sent to Mark Pomerantz, a former special assistant district attorney, and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan is summoning him to appear for a deposition behind closed doors on April 20. 
	<p>Jordan's letter stated that Pomerantz is uniquely situated to provide information that is relevant to the Committee’s oversight and potential legislative reforms regarding the investigation into former President Donald Trump’s finances.</p> 
	<p>It is unusual for Congress to subpoena a line prosecutor, but Jordan alleges that Bragg’s office directed Pomerantz not to cooperate with oversight. Pomerantz wrote a book that includes details of the investigation into Trump and the Trump organization, which could make the subpoena harder to resist.</p>
	<p>Recently, Trump appeared in court in New York and pled not guilty to 34 felony counts of “falsifying business records,” and this comes as Republicans weigh their next steps in their probe of Bragg’s office. The investigation has led to Republicans seeking testimony and official documents from Leslie Dubeck, Bragg’s general counsel, who criticized the investigation and urged Republicans to refrain from making baseless and inflammatory accusations.
	 <p>However, Jordan contends that the inquiry is linked to the national implications of prosecuting a former president, including the Secret Service’s role in protecting an ex-president who is also a criminal defendant. The House GOP is also considering using findings from the investigation to draft bills on the use of federal forfeiture funds.</p>
	<p>That would include, Jordan said, a potential prohibition of those funds’ use to investigate a current or former president, or a presidential candidate. (The Manhattan DA’s office disclosed that it has used federal forfeiture funds on expenses related to investigations of Trump or the Trump organization.)</p>
	<p>Jordan has stressed in a series of TV interviews this week that a subpoena of Bragg remains on the table. He’s also left the door open to the DA voluntarily appearing or even Republicans focusing first on other individuals in Bragg’s orbit.</p>
	<p>Pomerantz and Carey Dunne are of particular interest to House Republicans, since both resigned from Bragg’s office earlier this year — reportedly because of Bragg’s doubts at the time about moving forward with the Trump case. Thursday’s subpoena comes after Jordan fired off letters to both Pomerantz and Dunne last month, but has not issued a similar subpoena to Dunne.</p>
